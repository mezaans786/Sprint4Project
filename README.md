Link to dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashaychoudhary/panic-attack-dataset

This dataset is designed to help analyze panic attacks by exploring potential triggers, symptoms, and associated lifestyle factors. It includes details such as age, gender, panic attack frequency, duration, heart rate, sweating, chest pain, trembling, medical history, medication use, caffeine intake, exercise frequency, sleep patterns, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, therapy participation, and panic severity scores.

Although this dataset has many factors, I plan to examine the most common triggers for panic attacks and identify which gender in each age group is most affected by them.

In order for this code to run smoothly the following libraries must be imported:
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
import plotly.express
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
